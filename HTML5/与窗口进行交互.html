        There are lots of different kinds of fruits - there are over 600 varirites
        of banana alone.By the times we add the countless types of apples,
        and other well-konwn fruits, we are faced with thousands of choices.

        One of the most interesting aspects of fruits is the varirty available in
        each country. I live near London, in an area which is the konwn for
        its apples.
